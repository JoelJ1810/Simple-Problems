1. Write a Python program to check whether a string is numeric.
2. Ask the user to enter a string s and a number i, print s for i times, each in a line.
3. Write a Python program to reverse the digits of a given number and add it to the
original, If the sum is not a palindrome repeat this procedure.
4. Write a Python program to create all possible strings by using &#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;. Use the
characters exactly once.
5. Get a string which contains numbers and characters, print the sum and average of the
numbers present in the string.
6. When a character is consecutive in a string, it is possible to shorten the character
string by replacing the character with a special character. For example, in the case of
the character string YYYYY, if it is expressed as # 5 Y, it is compressed by one
character. Write a Python program to restore the original string by entering the
compressed string with this rule. However, the # character does not appear in the
restored character string
Example:
The restored character string for each character on one line.
Original text: TJ#5Y2#6431
Restored Text: TJYYYYY244444431
7. Replace each special character with # in the following string
($%% I am @Christ in Bangalore!! **$$
Hint: use string.punctuation
8. Get three strings from user. Form a new string using first character of first string,
second character of second string etc. Repeat the same from the reverse order. (Eg:
last character of the first string, last character of second string etc.)

9. Write a Python program to read a long text which contains only alphabets and space;
and should print two words. The first one is the word which appears most frequently
in the text. The second one is the word which has the maximum number of letters
