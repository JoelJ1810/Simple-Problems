A manager of an internet service provider company wants to analyze the system usage from
the log records to find the utilization of the system. He wants to know for how long did each
user use the system?
When the user wants to use the system he must login to the system ( start time e.g. 12:30) and
after finishing the work he must log out off the system ( end time eg. 18:10).
The time format is the 24-hour system hours and minutes.
You may also assume that the data is valid and a user will login for less than 24 hours. If
end time is less than the start time it means that the user logged in over the night.
Write a menu driven program in C language using functions to do the following tasks.
1. Read Login time(hour and minutes format)
2. Read Log out time(hour and minutes format)
3. To convert the time in hh and mm format to minutes and return minutes
4. To convert the minutes into hh and mm format
5. To display the difference between end time and start time in hh and mm format
