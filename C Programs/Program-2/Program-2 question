Write definitions for two functions. The first function sum() takes an argument, int array, and
returns the sum of all the elements of the passed array. The 2 nd function sumArray() takes
two argument, an int array and a character ('E' or 'O'). if the passed character is 'E', it
returns the sum of even elements of the passed array and if the passed character is 'O', it
returns the sum of odd elements. Implement the functions in main(). There must be at least
three options in the menu, array sum, odd element sum and even element sum.
